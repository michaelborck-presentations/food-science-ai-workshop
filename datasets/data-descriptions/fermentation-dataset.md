# Fermentation Study dataset

- **4 treatments**: Control, L. plantarum, L. plantarum + inulin, L. acidophilus
- **9 time points**: 0 to 48 hours (every 6 hours)
- **8 measurements**: pH, temperature, LAB counts, viscosity, protein, lactic acid, sensory scores
- **36 total observations** (manageable for demo but rich enough for analysis)

## Key features that make this great for demos:
1. **Clear trends**: pH drops, LAB grows, viscosity increases with fermentation
2. **Treatment differences**: L. plantarum + inulin performs best (highest sensory scores)
3. **Realistic variability**: Small temperature fluctuations, expected biological variation
4. **Story potential**: "Look how adding inulin as a prebiotic improved both texture AND taste!"

## Microsoft Forms Poll Setup:
Create a simple form with:
- **Question**: "Which dataset should we analyze together?"
- **Options**: 
  - ðŸ¥› Fermentation Study (Oat Milk)
  - ðŸ“… Shelf Life Analysis  
  - ðŸ‘… Sensory Panel Data
  - ðŸ§ª Process Optimization
- **Settings**: Show results automatically, allow anonymous responses

During presentation: "Scan this QR code and vote! We'll use real-time results..."

Want me to create the other three datasets as well, so you're fully prepared regardless of which one wins?
