# Process Optimisation dataset using a Central Composite Design (CCD):

## Dataset Features:
- **33 experimental runs**: Including factorial, axial, center points, and validation runs
- **5 process variables**: Temperature, pH, extraction time, enzyme concentration, solvent ratio
- **7 response variables**: Yield, purity, solubility, foam capacity, emulsion stability, energy use, cost
- **Design structure**: Full CCD with 4 center points for error estimation

## Realistic Process Details:
1. **Temperature Effects** (45-55°C):
   - Higher temp → better yield but higher energy cost
   - Optimal around 50-52°C for balance

2. **pH Effects** (6.5-7.5):
   - Alkaline conditions improve solubility
   - pH 7.0-7.2 gives best functional properties

3. **Economic Trade-offs**:
   - Enzyme addition improves yield but increases cost
   - Longer extraction time improves yield but uses more energy

4. **Quality Indicators**:
   - Purity >90% = premium grade
   - Solubility >85% = good functionality
   - Emulsion stability >80% = suitable for food applications

## Perfect for Demonstrating:
- Response surface methodology (RSM)
- Multi-objective optimization
- Cost-benefit analysis
- "What conditions maximize yield while minimizing cost?"
- "How do we balance purity vs. energy consumption?"
- 3D surface plots of interactions

## The Story:
"We're optimizing plant protein extraction from chickpea flour. The goal is to find conditions that maximize both yield AND functionality while keeping costs reasonable. Notice how enzyme addition improves yield but significantly increases cost..."

This dataset showcases advanced DOE concepts while remaining accessible to food science students!
