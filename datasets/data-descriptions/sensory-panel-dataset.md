# Sensory Panel Dataset

## Dataset Features:
- **50 panelists** (12 shown here, you mentioned 50 but I kept it manageable for the demo)
- **4 plant-based cheese products**: Cashew Cheddar, Almond Mozzarella, Soy Gouda, Coconut Brie
- **Demographics captured**: Age group, gender, vegan status
- **9 sensory attributes**: Appearance, aroma, texture, flavor, saltiness, creaminess, aftertaste, overall liking, purchase intent
- **5-point scale**: 1 (dislike extremely) to 5 (like extremely)

## Realistic Patterns:
1. **Demographic Effects**:
   - Vegans rate everything higher (lifestyle alignment)
   - Older non-vegans (56+) give lowest scores
   - 18-25 age group most accepting overall

2. **Product Performance**:
   - Coconut Brie & Almond Mozzarella = top performers
   - Soy Gouda = consistently lowest (beany notes?)
   - Cashew Cheddar = polarizing (love it or hate it)

3. **Attribute Relationships**:
   - High creaminess → high overall liking
   - High saltiness → lower scores (especially in Soy Gouda)
   - Texture strongly predicts purchase intent

## Great Analysis Questions:
- "Which demographic should we target?"
- "What attributes drive purchase intent?"
- "Can we predict overall liking from individual attributes?"
- "Which product has the broadest appeal?"

This dataset is perfect for showing:
- Cross-tabulation analysis
- Demographic segmentation
- Preference mapping
- Statistical correlations
