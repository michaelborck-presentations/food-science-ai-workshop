# Shelf life dataset

## Dataset Features:

- **4 products**: Soy, Almond, Coconut, and Oat yogurt alternatives
- **7 time points**: Days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28
- **2 storage temperatures**: 4째C (refrigerated) and 10째C (temperature abuse)
- **10 quality parameters**: pH, microbial counts, color values, syneresis, firmness, overall quality

## Realistic Details:

1. **Microbial Growth**: 
   - TVC (Total Viable Count) increases over time
   - Yeast & mold show exponential growth, especially at 10째C
   - "Less than 10" notation for below detection limit

2. **Physical Changes**:
   - Syneresis (whey separation) increases dramatically
   - Firmness decreases as structure breaks down
   - Color shifts (L* decreases = darker, b* increases = yellowing)

3. **Product Differences**:
   - Coconut yogurt = most stable (high fat content)
   - Oat yogurt = least stable (high starch, prone to syneresis)
   - Temperature abuse (10째C) shows accelerated deterioration

## Great Demo Opportunities:
- "Which product has the best shelf life?"
- "How does temperature affect quality?"
- "What's the relationship between pH and microbial growth?"
- "Can we predict when each product becomes unacceptable?"

This dataset tells a clear story about food safety and quality that students can relate to - perfect for demonstrating AI's analytical capabilities!
