Today we'll practice Steps 1-3 together, demo 4-7, then build an agent to do it all!
:::

---

## Let's Get Started! üéØ {background-color="#1a2c1a"}

### Step 1: Idea Generation *(8 minutes)*

**Everyone follow along:**

1. Open Microsoft Copilot
2. Copy this prompt exactly:

```text
You are an AI research scientist specializing in Food Science.
Given the following research area, generate 5 distinct and 
innovative scientific hypotheses suitable for a Masters-level 
research paper.

For each hypothesis, include:
- A clear Title
- 3-5 Keywords  
- A short Abstract (under 200 words)
- An explanation of its Novelty and Significance

Research Area: "Plant-based dairy alternatives"
```

::: {.callout-note}
**Timer:** Take exactly 5 minutes to run this and read the results
:::

::: {.notes}
Give students 2-3 minutes to run this. Walk around and help anyone struggling.
:::

---

## What Did You Notice? ü§î

### Share Your Observations *(3 minutes)*

:::: {.incremental}
- Did Copilot generate exactly 5 hypotheses?
- Were they all truly distinct?
- How was the formatting?
- Any surprising ideas?
- Quality of the abstracts?
::::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
**Key Learning:** Even with identical prompts, AI can generate different outputs. This diversity is a feature, not a bug!
:::

. . .

## Introducing CRAFT: Better Prompts, Better Results üéØ

### The Problem You Just Experienced
- Vague outputs? Missing context.
- Generic responses? No role assigned.
- Wrong format? Didn't specify what you wanted.

. . .

### The CRAFT Solution

| **C** | **Context** | "This is food science research data..." |
| **R** | **Role** | "You are an expert food scientist..." |
| **A** | **Action** | "Generate 5 innovative hypotheses..." |
| **F** | **Format** | "Present as a structured table..." |
| **T** | **Tone/Target** | "Use academic language for peer review..." |

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
**Try it now:** Look at the prompt you just used. Which CRAFT elements were missing? How could you improve it?
:::

. . .

**Remember:** CRAFT is your conversation starter, not your final answer. Follow up, refine, iterate!

### Success Check: ‚úÖ
- Ideas are specific and detailed
- Academic language throughout
- Clear research questions

### Red Flags: ‚ùå
- Vague or generic suggestions
- Repetitive ideas
- No specific methodology mentioned

---

## Exporting Your Results üìä

### Making Your Work Persistent

**In Copilot:**
1. Look for the **"Export"** or **"Copy"** button
2. Options might include:
   - Copy to clipboard
   - Export to Word
   - Export to Excel (for tables)

. . .

**Pro Tip:** Create a folder structure now:
```
Research_Project_[Today's Date]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_Ideas/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_Experiments/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_Data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_Analysis/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 05_Manuscripts/
```

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
**Organization = Success:** Name files with step numbers so you can track progress!
:::

---

## Step 2: Scoring and Selection üéØ

### Copy your hypotheses back into Copilot *(5 minutes)*

**New prompt:**
```text
Here are 5 research hypotheses I generated. 
Please score each from 1-10 on:
- Originality (1=common, 10=groundbreaking)
- Feasibility (1=impossible, 10=easily doable for Masters)  
- Potential Impact (1=minor contribution, 10=field-changing)

Present as a table with total scores and recommend the top 3.
Explain your reasoning for the scores.

[PASTE YOUR 5 HYPOTHESES HERE]
```

. . .

**Take 3 minutes to run this, then we'll discuss results**

. . .

**Question:** Which hypothesis scored highest? Do you agree with the AI's reasoning?

---

## Step 3: Feasibility Testing üß™

### Let's Design an Experiment! *(10 minutes)*

**Select your top hypothesis and use this prompt:**

```text
I have selected this hypothesis:
[PASTE YOUR #1 HYPOTHESIS]

Design a minimal, step-by-step experimental plan to test 
its basic feasibility. This should be a small-scale 
prototype, not a full study.

Include:
- Materials needed (be specific about equipment)
- Step-by-step procedure (numbered list)
- Expected measurements and units
- Estimated timeline with milestones
- Budget estimate (if possible)
- Potential challenges and solutions

After the plan, generate a small table of simulated 
data (5-10 rows) showing what results we might expect.
```

::: {.callout-note}
**Timer:** 7 minutes to run this, 3 minutes to review your results
:::

---

## Checkpoint: Evaluating Your Progress üìä

### Success Metrics for Steps 1-3

**Your outputs should have:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**‚úÖ Quality Indicators:**
- Specific numerical values

- Detailed procedures
- Realistic resource needs
- Academic language
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**‚ùå Warning Signs:**
- Vague instructions
- Unrealistic timelines
- Missing key details
- Generic recommendations
- No specific measurements
:::
::::

. . .

### Quick Poll: How Are We Doing?
- üü¢ **Green:** My outputs are detailed and actionable
- üü° **Yellow:** Some good parts, some vague parts  
- üî¥ **Red:** Most outputs are too generic

::: {.callout-tip}
**If you're yellow/red:** Try adding "Be more specific" to your prompts!
:::

---

## Time for the Data Demo! üìà {background-color="#1a1a2c"}

### Your Choice Matters

2. List all the variables/columns and their units
3. Provide basic statistics (mean, min, max) for numerical columns
4. Tell me how many observations are in the dataset
5. Identify any missing or unusual values
```

::: {.callout-note}
**Take 2 minutes** to run this and read the results carefully
:::

::: {.notes}
Give students time to upload. Help anyone having issues.
:::

## Exploratory Data Analysis üîç

### Let's Dig Deeper! *(12 minutes total)*

**Prompt 1:** *(3 min)*
```text
What patterns or trends do you see in this data? 
Look for relationships between variables, changes over time, 
and differences between groups/treatments.
```

. . .

**Prompt 2:** *(3 min)*
```text
Which treatment/product/condition performs best? 
Explain your reasoning with specific numbers from the data.
```

. . .

**Prompt 3:** *(3 min)*
```text

```

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Notice how we're using natural language instead of coding? This is the power of AI-assisted analysis!
:::

**Debrief:** *(3 min)* Share one interesting finding with the person next to you

---

## Creating Visualizations üìä

### A Picture Worth 1000 Data Points *(10 minutes)*

**Visualization prompt:** *(7 min)*

```text
Create a professional scientific figure showing:
[CUSTOMIZE BASED ON DATASET]:
- Fermentation: pH over time for all treatments with error bars
- Shelf life: Quality score degradation curves by product
- Sensory: Spider/radar chart comparing all products  
- Process: 3D surface plot showing yield vs temperature and pH

Requirements:
- Include proper axis labels with units
- Add a clear legend
- Use scientific color scheme
- Write a detailed figure caption
- Suggest statistical tests for the differences shown
```

. . .

**Image troubleshooting:** *(3 min)*
- Can't see the image? Check browser permissions
- Image looks wrong? Try "regenerate" or refine the prompt
- No image capability? The data interpretation is still valuable!

---

## Advanced Statistical Analysis üßÆ

### Getting Sophisticated *(8 minutes)*

**Let's get statistical:**
```text
Perform appropriate statistical analysis for this dataset:

1. Are the differences between groups statistically significant? 
   Suggest and explain appropriate tests.

2. What correlations exist between variables? 
   Report correlation coefficients where relevant.

3. Can you build a simple predictive model? 
   Which variables best predict the main outcome?

4. What would you recommend based on this data? 
   Provide specific, actionable conclusions.

5. What are the limitations of this analysis?
   What additional data would strengthen the conclusions?
```

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
**Remember:** AI-generated statistics should be verified with proper statistical software for publication!
:::

. . .

**Review time:** *(2 min)* Does the statistical approach make sense for your data type?

---

## From Data to Presentation üé§

### The Magic Move *(7 minutes)*

**Final data prompt:**

```text
Based on all our analysis, create a 3-slide PowerPoint summary:
