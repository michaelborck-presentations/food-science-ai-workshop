# Let's Get Started! 


## Step 1: Idea Generation 

**Everyone follow along:**

1. Open Microsoft Copilot
2. Copy this prompt exactly:

```
"What are some food science research ideas?"
```

# What Did You Notice? ü§î

- Did Copilot generate hypotheses?
- Were they all truly distinct?
- How was the formatting?
- Any surprising ideas?
- Quality of the abstracts?


# **The Problem We Experienced**

- Vague outputs? Missing context.
- Generic responses? No role assigned.
- Wrong format? Didn't specify what you wanted.

# Introducing CRAFT: Better Prompts, Better Results

| Key | Section       | Description                               |
|-----|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **C** | **Context**    | "This is food science research data..."   |
| **R** | **Role**       | "You are an expert food scientist..."    |
| **A** | **Action**     | "Generate 5 innovative hypotheses..."    |
| **F** | **Format**     | "Present as a structured table..."        |
| **T** | **Tone/Target**| "Use academic language for peer review..."|

**Try it now:** Look at the earlier prompt. Which CRAFT elements were missing? How could you improve it?

**Remember:** CRAFT is your conversation starter, not your final answer. Follow up, refine, iterate!

# CRAFT Analysis

**‚ùå Before CRAFT (weak example):**

```
"What are some food science research ideas?"
```
or 

```
"Give me some research ideas about plant milk."
```

**Missing:**
- ‚ùå **Context:** No research level, paper type, or constraints
- ‚ùå **Role:** AI doesn't know what expertise to use
- ‚ùå **Action:** Vague "some ideas" vs. specific "5 hypotheses"
- ‚ùå **Format:** No structure for output
- ‚ùå **Tone:** Unclear if academic, industry, or casual


# Let's Get Started! (again!)

**Everyone follow along with YOUR topic:**

1. Open Microsoft Copilot
2. Use this CRAFT template with YOUR research area:

```
You are an AI research scientist specialising in Food Science.
Given the following research area, generate 5 distinct and 
innovative scientific hypotheses suitable for a Masters-level 
research paper.

For each hypothesis, include:
- A clear Title
- 3-5 Keywords  
- A short Abstract (under 200 words)
- An explanation of its Novelty and Significance

Research Area: "[YOUR TOPIC FROM HOMEWORK]"
```

# What Did You Notice?

**Share Your Observations** 

- Did Copilot generate exactly 5 hypotheses?
- Were they all truly distinct?
- How was the formatting?
- Any surprising ideas?
- Quality of the abstracts?

**Key Learning:** Even with identical CRAFT structures, AI generates different outputs based on YOUR specific topic. This diversity is valuable!


# ‚úÖ **CRAFT Analysis of This Prompt:**

| Element | ‚úÖ/‚ùå | What's There |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **C**ontext | ‚úÖ | "Given the following research area" + "Masters-level research paper" |
| **R**ole | ‚úÖ | "You are an AI research scientist specialising in Food Science" |
| **A**ction | ‚úÖ | "generate 5 distinct and innovative scientific hypotheses" |
| **F**ormat | ‚úÖ | Detailed list: Title, Keywords, Abstract, Novelty explanation |
| **T**one/Target | ‚úÖ | "scientific hypotheses" + "Masters-level" = academic tone |

::: {.notes}
**This is Actually a STRONG Prompt!**

**Why it works well:**

- **Specific role:** AI knows to think like a food science researcher
- **Clear task:** Exactly 5 hypotheses, not vague "some ideas"
- **Detailed format:** Structured output requirements
- **Appropriate level:** Masters-level sets the complexity
- **Rich context:** Specific research area provided
:::

# Did it work?

**Success Check: ‚úÖ**

- Ideas are specific and detailed
- Academic language throughout
- Clear research questions

**Red Flags: ‚ùå**

- Vague or generic suggestions
- Repetitive ideas
- No specific methodology mentioned

# Step 2: Scoring and Selection

**Copy your hypotheses back into Copilot** 

**New CRAFT prompt:**

```
Here are 5 research hypotheses I generated. 
Please score each from 1-10 on:
- Originality (1=common, 10=groundbreaking)
- Feasibility (1=impossible, 10=easily doable for Masters)  
- Potential Impact (1=minor contribution, 10=field-changing)

Present as a table with total scores and recommend the top 3.
Explain your reasoning for the scores.

[PASTE YOUR 5 HYPOTHESES HERE]
```

**Take 3 minutes to run this, then we'll discuss results**

**Question:** Which hypothesis scored highest? Do you agree with the AI's reasoning?

# Step 3: Feasibility Testing

**Let's Design an Experiment!**

**Select your top hypothesis and use this CRAFT prompt:**

```
I have selected this hypothesis:
[PASTE YOUR #1 HYPOTHESIS]

Design a minimal, step-by-step experimental plan to test 
its basic feasibility. This should be a small-scale 
prototype, not a full study.

Include:
- Materials needed (be specific about equipment)
- Step-by-step procedure (numbered list)
- Expected measurements and units
- Estimated timeline with milestones
- Budget estimate (if possible)
- Potential challenges and solutions

After the plan, generate a small table of simulated 
data (5-10 rows) showing what results we might expect.
```

# **Success Metrics for Steps 1-3**

**Your outputs should have:**

**‚úÖ Quality Indicators:**

- Specific numerical values
- Clear timelines
- Detailed procedures
- Realistic resource needs
- Academic language

**‚ùå Warning Signs:**

- Vague instructions
- Unrealistic timelines
- Missing key details
- Generic recommendations
- No specific measurements

# Quick Self Assessment

**Quick Poll: How Are We Doing?**

- üü¢ **Green:** My outputs are detailed and actionable
- üü° **Yellow:** Some good parts, some vague parts  
- üî¥ **Red:** Most outputs are too generic

**If you're yellow/red:** Try adding "Be more specific" to your prompts!

# Working with Real Data (Optional Demo)

**If You Have Data to Practice With...**

**For those who brought data or want to try our sample datasets:**

1. **Upload your CSV** to Copilot
2. **Ask basic questions** about patterns and trends
3. **Request simple visualisations**
4. **Generate interpretations**

# Sample CRAFT prompt for data:**
```
I've uploaded a food science dataset from [study type/context]. 
You are an experienced data analyst specialising in food research. 
Summarise the key findings and suggest 3 areas for deeper 
investigation that would be suitable for follow-up studies. 
Present as bullet points suitable for a research meeting, 
with each point including a brief rationale.
```
**Remember:** Always verify AI interpretations of your data!


# C.R.A.F.T Analysis

| Element | ‚úÖ/‚ùå | What's There |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **C**ontext | ‚úÖ | "I've uploaded a dataset form [study/type]" |
| **R**ole | ‚úÖ | "You are an experienced food research data analyst" |
| **A**ction | ‚úÖ | "Summarise key findings and suggest 3 areas for deeper investigation" |
| **F**ormat | ‚úÖ | "Present as bullet points" |
| **T**one/Target | ‚úÖ | "suitable for a research meeting and rationale" (professional/academic tone) |

::: {.notes}
**Why This Works Well:**

- **Clear context** about the data type
- **Specific role** that guides AI's analytical approach
- **Dual action** with exact quantity (3 areas)
- **Defined format** (bullet points)
- **Audience-specific tone** (research meeting = professional)
